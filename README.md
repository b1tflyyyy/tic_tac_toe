Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses, is a classic paper-and-pencil game that can now be played on a PC in the console using C++ programming language. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking either an 'X' or an 'O' in an empty cell. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while blocking your opponent from doing the same.

The C++ implementation of the game involves creating a grid array that keeps track of the current state of the game. Players take turns selecting a cell to mark with their symbol using input from the console. The program checks if the move is legal (i.e., if the cell is empty) and updates the grid with the new symbol. It then checks if a player has won the game by checking if any row, column, or diagonal contains three of the same symbol.

The game continues until a player wins or the grid is completely filled, resulting in a draw. The program then prompts the players to either play again or quit the game.

Overall, the C++ implementation of tic-tac-toe in the console is a fun and interactive way to play this classic game on a PC.
